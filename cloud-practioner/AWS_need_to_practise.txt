- Upload the same file (and have versioning)
- Delete the last file
- Delete one file (introduce delete marker)
- Rollback so we have back the deleted file

- Enable server access logging on the source s3 bucket

- Create s3 bucket as replication target

- Check if the replication is correct

- Upload an object with storage class x (you choose)
- create lifecycle rule
